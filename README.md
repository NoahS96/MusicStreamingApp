# MusicStreamingApp
Software Engineering Project

This app is for a software engineering class.
The end goals for the app are:
  - Connect the app to a server to retrieve data
  - Pull news card objects from the server
  - Play music streams from different server based radio stations
  - Gather user location data on app startup and send it to the server
  - Offer the ability to create alarms that play music on timeout
